- Reveals card numbers on cards themselves
- Reveals the card count for a given list
- Adds a card number to a created card
- Adds a card number head in the detail view
- Allows you to make card numbers bold
- Allows you to change the color of the card numbers
- Allows you to customize the format of the card numbers
